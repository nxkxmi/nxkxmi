## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nxkxmi, also known as Nikola. 
Iâ€™m 17 years old and currently learning the ropes of UI design. While I canâ€™t code or program just yet, I have a strong interest in designing user interfaces and app icons. 

## About me
- Current Skills: UI design, Figma (still learning)
- Interests: Designing UI/UX, creating app icons

I don't have much experience yet, but I'm really ambitious and eager to learn. Iâ€™m open to any collaborations and would love to work on projects that involve design. Although Iâ€™m not the best at coding, I have some ideas for projects that Iâ€™d like to explore.

## Plans
I have some ideas for apps that Iâ€™d like to develop, including:
- **Lifa App**: A concept for reality shifters.
- **Music Streaming App**: An app for streaming and discovering music.

Iâ€™m open to helping with UI design or app icons for any other projects you might have!
